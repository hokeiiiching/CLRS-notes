# Representation Of Graphs

G = (V,E) : Vertices, Edges
For characterizing running time, we measure size of input in terms of both |V| and |E|. **ONLY** in asymptotic notation, V denotes |V| and E denotes |E|, i.e. O(VE) denotes O(|V||E|).
Pseudocode: Vertex set is denoted as G.V and Edge set is denoted as G.E. V and E sets are viewed as attributes of a graph in pseudocode.

- Collection of adjacency lists || Adjacency matrix
- Adjacency list: For **sparse** graphs; |E| <<<< |V|**2.
- Adjacency Matrix: For **dense** graphs; |E| ~= |V|**2 || Tell quickly if there is an edge connecting 2 vertices.

## Adjancency-List 
- Array Adj[u] of |V| lists, one for each vertex.
- For each vertex u, Adj[u] contains all vertices v such that there is an edge from u to v.
- If G is **directed** graph, sum of lengths of all adjacency lists is |E|.
- If G is **undirected** grpah, sum of lengths of all adjancency lists is 2|E|, since u appears in v's adj list and vice versa.
- **BENEFIT**: Memory of each edge: O(V+E)
- Time to find each edge: O(V+E), since each |V| adj list must be examined. (Except in Connected, undirected or Strongly Connected, Directed graph, where it's O(E))
